  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard Markup
    language for <strong>crating <u>web</u> pages</strong>
    and web appications. Web browsers receive HTML documents
    from a web server or from local storage and render them
    into multimedia seb pages. HTML decribes the structure of
    a web page sematically and originally included cues for
    the appearance of the document.

  <p>A line break is the point at which two lines of text are <br>divided. In HTML, the br element creates a line <br>break. You can add it wherever you want text to end <br>on the current line and resume on the next.</p>

  <p>The HTML line break element can be used to display <br>poems, song lyrics, or other forms of content in which <br>the division of lines is significant.</p>

  <p>For example, say you’re <b>writing a blog post</b> about <br>how to address an envelope or package. You want to <br>include an example of how to format the sender’s and <br>recipient’s addresses. In that case, you could use the <br>line break element to place the sender’s and <br>recipient’s names, street addresses, and cities, states, <br>and ZIP codes all on separate lines.</p>

  <p>Below you’ll see the same address rendered in two <br>different ways. The first uses one paragraph element <br>and multiple line breaks. The second uses multiple <br>paragraph elements and no line breaks. As a result, <br>the margins are off.
